      Save service state 
      
      During uninstall some services might be holding Exchange files open, thereby 
      thwarting our attempt to uninstall without reboot. To prevent this, we need
      to stop these services before replacing files.
      
      To do this, we first save the state of the services if the file
      StoppedServices.xml is not present.  We always stop the services and disable
      only if we have saved the state. This is required in case uninstall fails
      during configuration of a role. A resume will uninstall the msi, so we need
      to stop the services. To preserve the state that was there on the first
      attempt of uninstall, the state files are not overwritten. 
      
      During post-setup, we'll restore the services to the state recorded here.

      This requires local machine admin permissions.
