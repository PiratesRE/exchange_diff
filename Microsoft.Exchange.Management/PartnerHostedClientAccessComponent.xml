    <!-- Make ServicePlanHostingRemap.csv.sample a non sample file -->
    <!-- We deploy ServicePlanHostingRemap.csv.sample that contains only sample offers. 
         We do not deploy it as a production file to avoid that an upgrade replace the file that was already modified with production offers.
         We should deploy this file always with the sample extension, so in case it gets replace no harm will be done on the production file.
         In case there is no production file we can make this file (sample) as non sample by renaming the extension.
