# Copyright (C) 2007 Microsoft Corporation.  All rights reserved.
#
# This file contains the regular expression used to parse RBAC queries in ECP.
# The query string must be a cmdlet assignment.
#
# A cmdlet includes at least the name of the required
# cmdlet but it can also include the name of the snap-in that implements the cmdlet,
# a set of parameters and scopes where there user must have read or write access.
#
# The captures out of this query must be:
#
# - An optional 'snapinName', containing the name of the snap-in.
#   Ex: Microsoft.Exchange.Management.PowerShell.E2010.
#   If defined, the snapin name must be followed by a non-captured '\' to separate it from the cmdlet name
#   and must not include the characters specified in MSDN "Writing a Windows PowerShell Snap-in".
#   If the snap-in is not specified, then the RBAC query assumes the cmdlet is from the Exchange
#   Microsoft.Exchange.Management.PowerShell.E2010 snap-in.
#
# - A mandatory 'cmdletName', containing the name of the cmdlet, in verb-noun form. Ex: get-mailbox.
#
# - An optional list of 'parameterName', following the cmdlet name and prefixed with a non-captured '?' or '%' (see E14 178569,202037).
#   The parameter names are separated by a non-captured '&', to indicate an 'and' requirement.
#
# - After the parameter, an optional list of scopes must follow, prefixed by a non-captured '@'.
#   Each one of the following scopes are optional, but at least one of them must be present if the '@'
#   character is present. Scopes are separated from each other with non-captured '&' and they must follow 
#   this order:
#
#   - The domain read scope is prefixed with R: and it is a single value, 
#     returned by the 'domainReadScope' capture.
#
#   - The domain write scope is prefixed with W: and it is a list separated by a non-captured '|',
#     to indicate an 'or' requirement. The domain write scopes are returned by the 'domainWriteScope' capture.
#
#   * The value of domain read and write scopes captures are limited to one of the following values:
#     'Organization', 'MyGAL', 'Self', 'MyDirectReports', 'OU', 'MyDistributionGroups' or 'MyExecutive'.
#
#   - The config scope is prefixed with C: and it is a single value, returned by the 'configScope' capture.
#     The value of the capture must be limited to 'OrganizationConfig'.
#
#   - The server scope is prefixed with S: and it is a single value, returned by the 'serverConfigScope' capture.
#     The value of the capture must be limited to 'ServerScope'.
#
# A sample rbac query string using all cmdlet assignment fields would look like this:
# Microsoft.Exchange.Management.PowerShell.E2010\move-mailbox?Identity&TargetDatabase@R:Organization&W:Self|MyDirectReports&C:OrganizationConfig&S:ServerScope
# 
# The above query can be read like this: 
# "check if the user can run the Microsoft.Exchange.Management.PowerShell.E2010\get-mailbox cmdlet
#  using the Identity and TargetDatabase parameters,
#  having read access in the organization scope
#  and write access to himself or to his direct reports 
#  and having access to the configuration scope and the server scope".
#
# Since snapin name, parameters and scopes are optional, pages that just need to check if the user
# has any type of access to a single Exchange cmdlet can simly state the cmdlet name, like 'get-mailbox'.
# 
# Other examples of valid queries:
# 
# move-mailbox
# move-mailbox?Identity
# move-mailbox?Identity&TargetDatabase
# move-mailbox@R:Organization&W:Self
# set-ExchangeServer?Identity&ErrorReportingEnabled@S:ServerScope
# customSnapIn\custom-cmdlet
#
